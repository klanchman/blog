What a great write-up on a series of wonderful, concerning hacks that Phoenix put together to quickly switch between Windows and their Hyperspace OS. Fragile, yes, but I can't help but admire it too. Although read-write access to the Windows partition definitely falls more on the "concerning" side of things.

I had all but forgotten that span of time when netbook makers had a "fast-booting" OS installed alongside Windows. It seems they didn't boot so fast after all. I vaguely remember wanting to get [Splashtop](https://www.phoronix.com/review/869) running on my own machine.
