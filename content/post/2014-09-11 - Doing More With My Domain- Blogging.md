I promised myself I wouldn't say I put a ["blag" on my "wobsite"](http://xkcd.com/148/), and yet I just can't resist.

I recently purchased this domain name using [Google Domains](http://domains.google.com) (which is an awesome service, by the way! Get yourself a beta invite!). As soon as I got it, I redirected my GitHub Pages site to this domain. However, it didn't feel like enough to just have my little one page site hosted here. I wanted to use my site for more than just general info and contact links. So...what about a blog?

I didn't really see a clear way to host WordPress on GitHub Pages, and I felt like WordPress would be a bit overkill for what I wanted to do. GitHub Pages mentions something about Jekyll, so I looked into that.

As far as I can tell, the setup I have here may not be considered "typical." I wanted to keep my main page largely as it was (a simple page made with Bootstrap), and I wanted to add a blog at /blog/. Beyond that, I wanted to maintain a similar theme across the website, so I needed to add Bootstrap to the blog. I actually found someone who had done something similar, so I followed [the guide on his website](https://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example/tutorial) and tweaked things where I needed to. I'm pretty happy with the results!

I hope I end up having time to update this blog semi-frequently. I have other stuff to talk about as far as how I'm using my domain to my advantage, and I always like to ramble on about tech stuff.
